# REST Countries

Introducing the Country Lookup Web Application! This user-friendly web app allows users to easily search for and explore detailed information about countries. Developed as a solution for the frontendmentor.io challenge, the app features a sleek interface with a responsive search bar and autocomplete suggestions for efficient searches. Once a country is selected or searched for, users are presented with a dedicated page displaying key details such as population, capital, area, and time zone. Additional information like languages, currencies, and neighboring countries is also available. The app incorporates interactive elements, including an interactive map, and offers a "Random Country" feature for users to discover interesting facts. With mobile responsiveness, users can access the app seamlessly on various devices.
